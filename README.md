# CREATOR BOUNTIES

Are you an NFT collection owner, team member or part of their DAO?

If so, what could you do if you have a bunch of its tokens obtained from the founder distribution minting or through in-code smart contracts rules (like Nouns), and want to encourage community members to create value for the collection?

I mean, basic activation mechanisms like:

- Single NFT token distributions.
- Direct ETH/stable token transfers.

are not efficient if you want to create bonding incentive mechanims for your collection holders.

So what could we do?

Imagine breaking down your NFTs into smaller units and rewarding community members by their contributions with fractionalized shares through bounty strategies; that's what creator bounties proposes.

This is possible by using PooledNFT!
